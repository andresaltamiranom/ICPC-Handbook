# Polygon

### Polygon typedef

```cpp

typedef vector<Point> Polygon;

```

The standard way to represent a Polygon is to simply enumerate the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order, with the first vertex being equal to the last vertex.

## Helper functions

### cross product

```cpp

ll cross(const Point &O, const Point &A, const Point &B) {
	return (A.x - O.x) * (B.y - O.y) - (A.y - O.y) * (B.x - O.x);
}

```

**Input:** Three Points.

**Output:** The cross product of the three points.

To get the cross product of three points, we have to calculate (q - p) x (r - p) where a x b is the determinant: a x b = (a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x).

## Polygon functions

### Convex hull

```cpp

Polygon convexHull(Polygon &P) {
	int n = P.size(), k = 0;
	Polygon H(2*n);
	sort(P.begin(), P.end());
	FOR(i, 0, n) {
		while (k >= 2 && cross(H[k-2], H[k-1], P[i]) <= 0) k--;
		H[k++] = P[i];
	}
	for (int i = n-2, t = k+1; i >= 0; i--) {
		while (k >= t && cross(H[k-2], H[k-1], P[i]) <= 0) k--;
		H[k++] = P[i];
	}
	H.resize(k);
	return H;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** The convex polygon of _P_.

Gets the convex polygon of a given polygon. The convex polygon is the smallest polygon which contains all of the vertices of the original polygon inside, as shown in this image:

To get the convex polygon, we use **Andrew's monotone chain algorithm**. First, we create a new Polygon with twice the size of the original, just to make sure the convex Polygon will fit in _H_. Then we sort the points lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, and in case of a tie, by y-coordinate). We'll then construct the upper and lower hulls of the points in O(n) time. An upper hull is the part of the convex hull, which is visible from the above. It runs from its rightmost point to the leftmost point in counterclockwise order. The lower hull is the remaining part of the convex hull. To do this, we loop twice through each set of points and, by getting its cross product, we get the direction of the turn of the current point and the previous two points. The first _for_ loop builds the lower hull, from left to right, by moving only in counterclockwise order (_cross() <= 0_). Then, for the upper hull, we go from right to left (hence starting at _n-2_), also moving in counterclockwise order.

This algorithm runs in O(n\*log(n)) time complexity.

### Polygon Area

```cpp

double area(const Polygon &P) {
	double result = 0.0, x1, y1, x2, y2;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)P.size()-1; i++) {
		x1 = P[i].x; x2 = P[i+1].x;
		y1 = P[i].y; y2 = P[i+1].y;
		result += (x1*y2-x2*y1);
	}
	return abs(result) / 2.0;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A double value, the area of the polygon _P_.

Calculates the area of a polygon of _n_ vertices given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. This can be calculated by computing the determinant of the matrix of form [[X0, Y0], [X1, Y1], [X2, Y2], ... [Xn-2, Yn-1], [Xn-1, Yn-1]].

### isConvex

```cpp

bool isConvex(const Polygon &P) {
	int sz = (int)P.size();
	if (sz <= 3) return false;
	bool isLeft = ccw(P[0], P[1], P[2]);
	for (int i = 1; i < sz-1; i++)
		if (ccw(P[i], P[i+1], P[(i+2) == sz ? 1 : i+2]) != isLeft)
			return false;
	return true;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the polygon _P_ is convex or not.

A polygon is said to be convex if any line segment drawn inside the polygon does not intersect any edge of the polygon. Otherwise, it is a concave polygon.

To check if a polygon is convex, we can simply check whether all three consecutive vertices of the polygon from the same turns (all left turns or all right turns). If at least one triple is different, then the polygon is concave.

### Point in Polygon

```cpp

bool inPolygon (Point pt, const Polygon &P) {
	if((int)P.size() == 0) return false;
	double sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)P.size()-1; i++) {
		if (ccw(pt, P[i], P[i+1]))
			sum += angle(P[i], pt, P[i+1]);
		else sum -= angle(P[i], pt, P[i+1]); }
	return abs(abs(sum) - 2*PI) < EPS;
}

```

**Input:** A Point and a Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the given point is inside the polygon.

Checks if a given point is inside a given concave or convex polygon. This function implements the **winding number algorithm**. This algorithm computes the sum of angles between three points: _P[i]_, _pt_, and _P[i+1]_. In this case, P[i] - P[i+1] are consecutive sides of polygon _P_, taking care of left turns (add the angle) and right turns (substract the angle) respectively. If the final sum is 2Ï€ (or 360 degrees), then _pt_ is inside polygon _P_.

### isSimple

```cpp

bool isSimple(const Polygon &p) {
  for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++) {
	for (int k = i+1; k < p.size(); k++) {
	  int j = (i+1) % p.size();
	  int l = (k+1) % p.size();
	  if (i == l || j == k) continue;
	  if (lineSegIntersect(p[i], p[j], p[k], p[l]))
		return false;
	}
  }
  return true;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the given polygon is simple or not.

Checks if a given polygon is a simple polygon. A simple polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight, non-intersecting line segments that are joined pair-wise to form a closed path.

The following image shows the difference between a simple (left) and a non-simple, or self-intersecting, (right) polygon.

To check if a polygon is simple, we check if there's two line segments that intersect each other, where each line segment is made up of two consecutive points in the polygon. For example, for a polygon with 5 vertices (numbered 0 to 4), we would check for an intersection between the line segment P0-P1 with P2-P3, then P0-P1 with P3-P4, and finally P1-P2 with P3-P4. If there's any intersection, then it's not a simple polygon.

### Cut polygon

```cpp

Point lineIntersectSeg(Point p, Point q, Point A, Point B) {
	double a = B.y - A.y;
	double b = A.x - B.x;
	double c = B.x*A.y - A.x*B.y;
	double u = abs(a*p.x + b*p.y + c);
	double v = abs(a*q.x + b*q.y + c);
	return Point((p.x*v + q.x*u) / (u+v), (p.y*v + q.y*u) / (u+v));
}

Polygon cutPolygon(Point a, Point b, const Polygon &Q) {
	Polygon P;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)Q.size(); i++) {
		double left1 = cross(toVec(a, b), toVec(a, Q[i+1])), left2 = 0;
		if (i != (int)Q.size()-1) left2 = cross(toVec(a, b), toVec(a, Q[i+1]));
		if (left1 > -EPS) P.pb(Q[i]);
		if (left1 * left2 < -EPS)
			P.pb(lineIntersectSeg(Q[i], Q[i+1], a, b));
	}
	if (!P.empty() && !(P.back() == P.front()))
		P.pb(P.front());
	return P;
}

```

**Input:**  Two points, representing a line segment, and a Polygon.

**Output:** A smaller Polygon after the cut was made.

The basic idea is to iterate through the vertices of the original polygon _Q_, one by one. If line _ab_ and polygon vertex _v_ form a left turn (which implies that _v_ is on the left side of the line _ab_), we put _v_ inside the new polygon _P_. Once we find a polygon edge that intersects with the line _ab_, we use that intersection point as part of the new polygon _P_. We then skip the next vertices of _Q_ that are located on the right side of the line _ab_ (since they will not form part of the new polygon). Sooner or later, we will revisit another polygon ede that intersects with line _ab_ again. We continue appending vertices of _Q_ into _P_  because we are now on the left side of line _ab_ again. We stop when we have returned to the starting vertex and return the resulting polygon _P_, making sure that the last point is also the first point.

The function _lineIntersectSeg()_ is used as a helper function to check if a line segment _pq_ intersects with a line _AB_.

### Intersection between two polygons

```cpp

// only works for convex
bool pointInPolygon(Polygon &p1, Point p) {
  FOR(i, 0, p1.size() - 1)
    if (cross(p1[i], p1[i+1], p) >= 0)
      return false;
  return true;
}

// polygons must be convex
// returns polygon with size < 3 if there is no intersection
Polygon intersection(Polygon &p1, Polygon &p2) {
  set<Point> result;
  FOR(i, 0, p1.size() - 1) {
    if (pointInPolygon(p2, p1[i]))
      result.insert(p1[i]);
    FOR(j, 0, p2.size() - 1) {
      Line l1 = Line(p1[i], p1[i+1]);
      Line l2 = Line(p2[j], p2[j+1]);
      vector<Point> ps1, ps2;
      ps1.pb(p1[i]); ps1.pb(p1[i+1]);
      ps2.pb(p2[j]); ps2.pb(p2[j+1]);
      sort(ps1.begin(), ps1.end());
      sort(ps2.begin(), ps2.end());
      if (!areParallel(l1, l2)) {
        Point intersect;
        bool b = areIntersect(l1, l2, intersect);
        if (b && checkPointInSegm(intersect, ps1[0], ps1[1]) && checkPointInSegm(intersect, ps2[0], ps2[1]))
          result.insert(intersect);          
      } else if (areSame(l1, l2)) {
        if (ps1[1] >= ps2[0] && ps2[1] >= ps1[0]) {
          vector<Point> ps3;
          ps3.pb(ps1[0]); ps3.pb(ps1[1]); ps3.pb(ps2[0]); ps3.pb(ps2[1]);
          sort(all(ps3));
          result.insert(ps3[1]);
          result.insert(ps3[2]);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  FOR(i, 0, p2.size() - 1) {
    if (pointInPolygon(p1, p2[i]))
      result.insert(p2[i]);
  }

  if (result.size() <= 2) {
    return Polygon(result.begin(), result.end());
  }

  Polygon p(result.begin(), result.end());
  return convexHull(p);
}

```

**Input:** Two polygons.

**Output:** A polygon outlining the intersection of the two original polygons.

Given two polygons, returns the resulting polygon of the intersection between the two original polygons. If there is no intersection, returns a polygon with size < 3. //TODO 

Here we use a different helper function _pointInPolygon()_ to find a point in a polygon. This function runs faster than the other function defined to find a point inside a polygon, but it only works for convex polygons, whereas the other function works for both convex and concave polygons. We can safely use this function since our function _intersection()_ only accepts convex polygons as input.
