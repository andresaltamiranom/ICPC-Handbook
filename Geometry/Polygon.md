# Polygon

### Polygon typedef

```cpp

typedef vector<Point> Polygon;

```

The standard way to represent a Polygon is to simply enumerate the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order, with the first vertex being equal to the last vertex.

## Helper functions

### cross product

```cpp

ll cross(const Point &O, const Point &A, const Point &B) {
	return (A.x - O.x) * (B.y - O.y) - (A.y - O.y) * (B.x - O.x);
}

```

**Input:** Three Points.

**Output:** The cross product of the three points.

To get the cross product of three points, we have to calculate (q - p) x (r - p) where a x b is the determinant: a x b = (a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x).

## Polygon functions

### Convex hull

```cpp

Polygon convexHull(Polygon &P) {
	int n = P.size(), k = 0;
	Polygon H(2*n);
	sort(P.begin(), P.end());
	FOR(i, 0, n) {
		while (k >= 2 && cross(H[k-2], H[k-1], P[i]) <= 0) k--;
		H[k++] = P[i];
	}
	for (int i = n-2, t = k+1; i >= 0; i--) {
		while (k >= t && cross(H[k-2], H[k-1], P[i]) <= 0) k--;
		H[k++] = P[i];
	}
	H.resize(k);
	return H;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** The convex polygon of _P_.

Gets the convex polygon of a given polygon. The convex polygon is the smallest polygon which contains all of the vertices of the original polygon inside, as shown in this image:

To get the convex polygon, we use **Andrew's monotone chain algorithm**. First, we create a new Polygon with twice the size of the original, just to make sure the convex Polygon will fit in _H_. Then we sort the points lexicographically (first by x-coordinate, and in case of a tie, by y-coordinate). We'll then construct the upper and lower hulls of the points in O(n) time. An upper hull is the part of the convex hull, which is visible from the above. It runs from its rightmost point to the leftmost point in counterclockwise order. The lower hull is the remaining part of the convex hull. To do this, we loop twice through each set of points and, by getting its cross product, we get the direction of the turn of the current point and the previous two points. The first _for_ loop builds the lower hull, from left to right, by moving only in counterclockwise order (_cross() <= 0_). Then, for the upper hull, we go from right to left (hence starting at _n-2_), also moving in counterclockwise order.

This algorithm runs in O(n\*log(n)) time complexity.

### Polygon Area

```cpp

double area(const Polygon &P) {
	double result = 0.0, x1, y1, x2, y2;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)P.size()-1; i++) {
		x1 = P[i].x; x2 = P[i+1].x;
		y1 = P[i].y; y2 = P[i+1].y;
		result += (x1*y2-x2*y1);
	}
	return abs(result) / 2.0;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A double value, the area of the polygon _P_.

Calculates the area of a polygon of _n_ vertices given in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. This can be calculated by computing the determinant of the matrix of form [[X0, Y0], [X1, Y1], [X2, Y2], ... [Xn-2, Yn-1], [Xn-1, Yn-1]].

### isConvex

```cpp

bool isConvex(const Polygon &P) {
	int sz = (int)P.size();
	if (sz <= 3) return false;
	bool isLeft = ccw(P[0], P[1], P[2]);
	for (int i = 1; i < sz-1; i++)
		if (ccw(P[i], P[i+1], P[(i+2) == sz ? 1 : i+2]) != isLeft)
			return false;
	return true;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the polygon _P_ is convex or not.

A polygon is said to be convex if any line segment drawn inside the polygon does not intersect any edge of the polygon. Otherwise, it is a concave polygon.

To check if a polygon is convex, we can simply check whether all three consecutive vertices of the polygon from the same turns (all left turns or all right turns). If at least one triple is different, then the polygon is concave.

### inPolygon

```cpp

bool inPolygon (Point pt, const Polygon &P) {
	if((int)P.size() == 0) return false;
	double sum = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < (int)P.size()-1; i++) {
		if (ccw(pt, P[i], P[i+1]))
			sum += angle(P[i], pt, P[i+1]);
		else sum -= angle(P[i], pt, P[i+1]); }
	return abs(abs(sum) - 2*PI) < EPS;
}

```

**Input:** A Point and a Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the given point is inside the polygon.

Checks if a given point is inside a given concave or convex polygon. This function implements the **winding number algorithm**. This algorithm computes the sum of angles between three points: _P[i]_, _pt_, and _P[i+1]_. In this case, P[i] - P[i+1] are consecutive sides of polygon _P_, taking care of left turns (add the angle) and right turns (substract the angle) respectively. If the final sum is 2Ï€ (or 360 degrees), then _pt_ is inside polygon _P_.

### isSimple

```cpp

bool isSimple(const Polygon &p) {
  for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++) {
	for (int k = i+1; k < p.size(); k++) {
	  int j = (i+1) % p.size();
	  int l = (k+1) % p.size();
	  if (i == l || j == k) continue;
	  if (lineSegIntersect(p[i], p[j], p[k], p[l]))
		return false;
	}
  }
  return true;
}

```

**Input:** A Polygon.

**Output:** A boolean value, whether the given polygon is simple or not.

Checks if a given polygon is a simple polygon. A simple polygon is a flat shape consisting of straight, non-intersecting line segments that are joined pair-wise to form a closed path.

The following image shows the difference between a simple (left) and a non-simple, or self-intersecting, (right) polygon.
